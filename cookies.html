                    <p>Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site. Cookies allow websites to recognize users and remember their preferences, such as login details and other preferences. They also help analyze how visitors interact with our website so we can improve our services. Cookies do not access any information stored on your computer or mobile device beyond what you provide voluntarily.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">2. Types of Cookies We Use</h2>
                    <p>We use several types of cookies on our website, including strictly necessary cookies, performance cookies, functionality cookies, and targeting cookies. Strictly necessary cookies are essential for the website to function properly. Performance cookies collect information about how visitors use the site, such as which pages are most frequently visited. Functionality cookies remember choices you make to improve your experience. Targeting cookies are used to deliver content that is more relevant to you and your interests, based on your browsing habits.</p>
                </div>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">3. Strictly Necessary Cookies</h2>
                    <p>These cookies are essential for enabling user navigation and providing access to secure areas of our website. Without these cookies, certain services you request, such as adding items to your shopping cart or accessing your account, cannot be provided. These cookies do not gather information about you for marketing purposes. They are typically set in response to actions made by you, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling out forms. You can set your browser to block these cookies, but some parts of the site may not work as a result.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">4. Performance Cookies</h2>
                    <p>Performance cookies help us understand how visitors interact with our website by collecting and reporting information anonymously. These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies, we will not know when you have visited our site and will not be able to monitor its performance. These cookies may be set by third-party services we use, such as Google Analytics.</p>

                <div class="cookie-point">
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">5. Functionality Cookies</h2>
                    <p>Functionality cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalization based on your choices. They may be set by us or by third-party providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these cookies, some or all of these services may not function properly. These cookies remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organizations such as advertisers. They are also used to track your activity across different websites and build a profile of your interests.</p>

                <div class="cookie-point">
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">6. Targeting Cookies</h2>
                    <p>Targeting cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant advertisements on other sites. They do not store directly personal information but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising. These cookies work by tracking your browsing habits and making assumptions about your preferences and interests based on the websites you visit.</p>

                <div class="cookie-point">
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">7. First-Party Cookies</h2>
                    <p>First-party cookies are set by the website you are visiting and can only be read by that site. These cookies are essential for the website to function correctly and to provide services you have requested. They are generally used for functionality like retaining your preferences or items in your shopping cart. First-party cookies are typically considered less intrusive than third-party cookies as they only relate to the website you are currently visiting and not to other websites you may visit in the future.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="cookie-point">
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">8. Third-Party Cookies</h2>
                    <p>Third-party cookies are set by domains other than the one you are visiting directly, hence the name "third-party." These cookies are often used for advertising and analytics purposes. Common examples include cookies from social media platforms, advertising networks, and external service providers. These cookies can track your browsing activity across multiple websites to build a detailed profile of your interests for targeted advertising purposes. We carefully select our third-party partners and require them to comply with applicable privacy laws.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">9. Session Cookies</h2>
                    <p>Session cookies are temporary cookies that are erased when you close your browser. They store your activities during your current browsing session but do not persist once the session ends. These cookies are necessary for many basic website functions, such as maintaining the contents of your shopping cart or keeping you logged in as you move between pages. Without session cookies, many interactive features of modern websites would not work correctly. They typically do not collect information from your computer that could be used to identify you.</p>

                <div class="cookie-point">
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">10. Persistent Cookies</h2>
                    <p>Persistent cookies remain on your device for a set period of time specified in the cookie (from minutes to several years) or until you manually delete them. Unlike session cookies, persistent cookies are not deleted when your browser is closed. These cookies store information such as your login credentials so you don't have to enter them every time you return to our site. Persistent cookies also help us recognize you when you return to our website and allow us to remember your preferences for future visits.</p>

They help us understand how our website is performing and identify areas for improvement. Cookies enable essential functions like authentication and security processes. We also use them to deliver content tailored to your interests and measure the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.

                    <p>You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies through our cookie consent banner when you first visit our website. You can also set or amend your browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our website though your access to some functionality and areas may be restricted. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser settings to decline cookies if you prefer. The Help menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies.</p>

Google Analytics uses first-party cookies to collect standard internet log information and visitor behavior information in an anonymous form. The information generated by these cookies about your use of the website (including your IP address) is transmitted to Google. We use this information to evaluate visitors' use of our website and compile statistical reports on website activity.

                    <p>The length of time a cookie will remain on your computer or mobile device depends on whether it is a persistent or session cookie. Session cookies expire when you close your browser, while persistent cookies remain stored on your device until deleted or until they reach their expiration date. The duration of persistent cookies varies, with some lasting only a few minutes while others may remain for several years. We carefully consider the appropriate duration for each cookie we set, balancing user experience with privacy considerations. You can delete any cookies already on your computer through your browser settings.</p>
